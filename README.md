# Gopher Hours

Gopher hours is a platform where UMN students can find information about
TAs office hours all in one place. Gone are the days of checking the
class calendar for every course you're enrolled in, just check
gopher hours!

In order to user gopher hours, you must sign in to your google account,
(a relatively painless process), so you can be properly be identified when it's
time to start learning.

TODOS:
* redo search on the main page
* Individual office hours page
  * Handle editing description easily
  * Queue feature (there's big potential here)
    * Ambitious, but send texts/emails/maybe notifications its their turn?
  * Host options to change things around, move queue around too?
* Chat feature, web sockets? or just databse stuff
  * If database, live update?
* More filtering options if necessary
* Mobile styling (and styling in general)
  * dark mode?
* Update firestore rules
* Generate qr code?
