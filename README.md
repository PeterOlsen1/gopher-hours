# Gopher Hours

Gopher hours is a platform where UMN students can find information about
TAs office hours all in one place. Gone are the days of checking the
class calendar for every course you're enrolled in, just check
gopher hours!

In order to user gopher hours, you must sign in to your google account,
(a relatively painless process), so you can be properly be identified when it's
time to start learning.

TODOS:
* Calender view
  * User customization of colors?
* Chat feature
  * Give host priveliges to delete chats?

* Mobile styling (and styling in general)
* Update firestore rules
* Migrate to typescript? (yikes)
